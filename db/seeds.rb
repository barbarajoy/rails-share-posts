  title: "The Inevitable Decline Of TypeScript Has Begun",
  content: "Hang on. Where is my 'I told you so' banner? Ahh, there we go. Under the bed. I knew it would come in handy someday! üòÅ Jokes aside, the TLDR of this story is as simple and as straightforward as I imagined it would be when the time came. Major players in the software engineering field are ditching TypeScript, for the very same reasons I never became much of a fan: polluted code with type gymnastics, extra compilation/build time and other practical reasons.
  The likes of Svelte, SvelteKit and Turbo 8 are all doing the diametrically opposite of what most web developers were expecting ‚Äî either seeking alternatives to TS or ditching it completely. This might sound shocking to many, but the reasons are all exactly what I expected, rooted in real-world pragmatism ‚Äî something that often eludes overly zealous software engineers, who prefer doing things for the sake of tech and tech alone. The story of TypeScript is a bit like that.",

  content: "Years ago, I never realized there were specific rules for writing commit messages until my curiosity got the best of me. I used to think that straightforward messages like ‚Äúadded feature 2,‚Äù ‚Äúfixed the bug on the Main Navigation bar,‚Äù or even ‚Äúfoo‚Äù were sufficient. The conviction that commit messages went largely unread proved mistaken. In reality, well-crafted commit messages are indispensable, ensuring that our future selves benefit from our diligence and thoughtfulness.",
