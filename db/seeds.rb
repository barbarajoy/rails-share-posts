  title: "Why Web UI Development Is So Hard?",
  content: "Web UI development might appear straightforward at first glance, but delve deeper and you‚Äôll discover a multitude of complexities that challenge even seasoned developers. This piece aims to dissect the inherent challenges of web UI development, from the discrepancy between web languages and the modern UI requirements, to intricate data management issues and asynchronous API calls.
  We'll also explore often-overlooked ‚Äúunhappy paths‚Äù such as loading states, error handling, and broader architecture considerations encompassing security, performance, and accessibility.",

  title: "The Inevitable Decline Of TypeScript Has Begun",
  content: "Hang on. Where is my 'I told you so' banner? Ahh, there we go. Under the bed. I knew it would come in handy someday! üòÅ Jokes aside, the TLDR of this story is as simple and as straightforward as I imagined it would be when the time came. Major players in the software engineering field are ditching TypeScript, for the very same reasons I never became much of a fan: polluted code with type gymnastics, extra compilation/build time and other practical reasons.
  The likes of Svelte, SvelteKit and Turbo 8 are all doing the diametrically opposite of what most web developers were expecting ‚Äî either seeking alternatives to TS or ditching it completely. This might sound shocking to many, but the reasons are all exactly what I expected, rooted in real-world pragmatism ‚Äî something that often eludes overly zealous software engineers, who prefer doing things for the sake of tech and tech alone. The story of TypeScript is a bit like that.",

  content: "Years ago, I never realized there were specific rules for writing commit messages until my curiosity got the best of me. I used to think that straightforward messages like ‚Äúadded feature 2,‚Äù ‚Äúfixed the bug on the Main Navigation bar,‚Äù or even ‚Äúfoo‚Äù were sufficient. The conviction that commit messages went largely unread proved mistaken. In reality, well-crafted commit messages are indispensable, ensuring that our future selves benefit from our diligence and thoughtfulness.",

  My name is Benoit. I have been a software engineer for the past eight and a half years. I stayed at my previous (and first) company for seven and a half years, then I joined a new one in early 2022.
  This article comes from a recent self-reflection on the things I wish I had started doing earlier in my career and the things I wish I had done differently.
  What I am sharing here may be useful to any junior to mid-level developer who wishes to improve and progress toward the title of senior and beyond.",

  I'm not entirely certain how people can become so arrogant with 3 years of experience, but there you go.",
